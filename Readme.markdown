# People.framework

[![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

This is an example framework for iOS & Mac.

## Installation

[Carthage](https://github.com/carthage/carthage) is the recommended way to install People. Add the following to your Cartfile:

``` ruby
github "soffes/ExampleFramework"
```

For manual installation, I recommend adding the project as a subproject to your project or workspace and adding the framework as a target dependency.


## Usage

```swift
import People

let person = Person(name: "Sam")
```

Enjoy.
